% Input:
% dictionarySize: the number of visual words in the dictionary
% imagePaths: a cell array containing paths of the images
% wordMapDir: directory name which contains all the wordmaps
% Output:
% outputHistograms: a wordHist_size Ã— num_images matrix of histograms, which will
% store the histograms of training images.
